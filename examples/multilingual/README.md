# Multilingual website with Hugo

This example was kindly contributed by Egon Elbre in November 2013
as a wonderful proof-of-concept for internationalization (i18n)
and multilingualization (m17n) in Hugo-generated websites.

This example has been updated to show how to create a site using the multilingual
feature introduced in Hugo `v0.17`
